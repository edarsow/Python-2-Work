# Python 2 Work
## Coding projects for CCAC's Python 2 by *Alex Hartle*

### Who I Am
My name is Alex Hartle and I am a student in CCAC's A.S. Cybersecurity program. I have a bachelor's degree in History and a master's degree in Teaching from the University of Pittsburgh, and am working through the program as part of a career change. I am without any prior IT experience but have fallen in love with the field and specifically the logic of programming and hope to enter a cybersecurity position upon graduation.

### Why I'm Here
Having taught myself Python fundamentals outside of classes, as well as having basic programming skills in Java, Bash, and HTML, I am taking Python 2 to improve my programming skills and enhance my understanding of the language that is most commonly used in my field. While not a data analytics student, Python-developed tools such as web crawlers have a high degree of crossover into my field in the form of passive information gathering. I look forward to learning more about Python and being able to develop my own tools and scripts for my security work while also getting a look into the field of data analytics.
